# -Most-Frequent-Decision-First-and-Most-Symmetries-Active-Search-Heuristics
“Most Frequent Decision First” and “Most Symmetries Active”  Search Heuristics

This is the implementation of the "Most-Frequent-Decision-First" and "Most-Symmetries-Active" search heuristics proposed in the paper "Jimmy H.M. Lee and Zichen Zhu.  Breaking More Composition Symmetries Using Search Heuristics, Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016), pages 3418-3425, Phoenix, Arizona, USA, February, 2016"

Please use Gecode Solver 4.2.0 to run these files.

Put Heuristic folder into gecode folder and DLS_He.cpp file into example folder.

To run the Diagonal Latin Square (DLS) problem (e.g. n=6) using symmetry breaking method LReSBDS:

./DLS_He 6
